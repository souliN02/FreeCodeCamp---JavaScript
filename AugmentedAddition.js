//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator. a should equal 15, b should equal 26, c should equal 19
//Original snippet from freeCodeCamp:
/*
let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;
*/

//Result:
let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
