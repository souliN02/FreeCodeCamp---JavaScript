# FreeCodeCamp---JavaScript
This is a school exercise about learing Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. 
The files names have been named according to the tasks from FreeCodeCamp.
When opening a file, the first few lines should describe what the goal of the task is and below that will be my answer for the task.
Please note that some of the files cant run or compile, as the task does not require runnable or executable code.
