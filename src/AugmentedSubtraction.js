//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator. a should equal 5, b should equal -6, c should equal 2
//Original snippet from freeCodeCamp:
/*
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;
*/

//Result:
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
