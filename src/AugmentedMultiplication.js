//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator. a should equal 25, b should equal 36, c should equal 46
//Original snippet from freeCodeCamp:
/*
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
*/

//Result:
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
