//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator. a should equal 4, b should equal 27, c should equal 3
//Original snippet from freeCodeCamp:
/*
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;
*/

//Result:
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
